Inter-process communication:
Due to the client-server architecture we used, this is spread throughout the application.
The resources package for the server contains the logic where responses are sent back to the client.
Each of the functions in the client file contains calls to the Unirest HTTP request library to communicate with the server.

Design patterns:
Interpreter pattern can be found in the server and client where the JSON is interpreted into objects.
Chain of responsibility is on the server where data is received from the client at each route, and then passed on to the database.
The server acts as a mediator between a client and its accounts.
